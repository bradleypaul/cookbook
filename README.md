Cookbook

My local grocery store hands out recipe cards on a weekly rotating basis. This project is an effort to collect the recipes so I
do not need to keep the paper copies and, in addition, demonstrate my ability developing websites.

I hope you enjoy it, and the live site can be found [here](http://cookbook.paulbradley.codes)
